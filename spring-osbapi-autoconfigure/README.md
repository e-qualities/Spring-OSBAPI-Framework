# Spring Open Service Broker API Framework - Auto-Configuration

This project provides auto-configurations for [Spring Open Service Broker API Framework](../spring-osbapi-framework/) and the various persistency Spring Boot starters.

Service broker developers should not have to use auto-configurations directly, but rather use the [`spring-osbapi-*-springboot-starter`s](../spring-osbapi-starters/).
